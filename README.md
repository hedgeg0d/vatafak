# Vatafak 
Vatafak is a virtual machine (VM) for [Brainfuck](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) which expands its capabilities. The standard Brainfuck, despite being a Turing-complete language, remains very limited in working with the OS, using randomness, and other aspects. Vatafak is an attempt to make the development of applications on Brainfuck more real and easier.

## Early version
This is a very early version of the project. I plan to add more features and improvements:
 - [x] More examples, such as Pong game
 - [ ] More draw function, such as `draw_circle`, `draw_text`
 - [ ] Functions for reading and writing files
 - [ ] Generate V-file to compile project. Even for android maybe :D
 - [ ] Optimize interpreter
 - [ ] Make tools for easier Brainfuck development
